# ðŸ“± Back Office User Profile

This project was created for a technical test. I was asked to make a back office user profile.

You can see a live demo deployed on Firebase on here: [DEMO](https://userprofile-backoffice.web.app/).

#### The required objectives where:
- A single page web for a user profile with two sections. âœ…
- In the first section the user can update her main information (email,gender,bio,name). âœ…
- At the second card the user will see a Google map with a marker with the current position. âœ…

#### The possible add-ons where:
- The user should have the possibilty to edit her photo. âœ…
- The form should be validated, username and email are required and the email should be a valid email showing error when this conditions fail. âœ…
-The map should change her current location and the marker location to the actual one that the user haves when he clicks the get location button. âœ…

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
